```{r setup, echo=FALSE, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Before we get started
- Have you installed packages knitr, rmarkdown, flexdashboard, and all previous ones?
- Could you click on File -> New -> R Markdown -> from template?
    - Did you see an option for "Flex dashboard"
- Did you create a new RStudio project and associated folder?
- Do you have the abiotic/herring/yourData data set in this folder (or data sub-folder)?
- Anything we need to review (R, RStudio, readr)???


## What this workshop is about
- Making interactive dashboards, i.e. putting your ggplotly objects into a dashboard, i.e. a single file interactive html file

- This workshop is not about:
    - dynamic documents
    - reproducible research
    - a markdown tutorial
- A workshop on the above is available if interested


## Review markdown
- Markdown is a light weight, text-to-html language (not R)
- R Markdown enables R code to be embedded in the markdown language
- knitr and rmarkdown packages: “knits” R code with text; converts the R Markdown files into various formats (html, Word, pdf, PowerPoint)
- Using this approach you can:
    - make documents, presentations, or dashboards (posters)
    - output as html, pdf, Word/PowerPoint, etc


## Review ggplot2 and plotly
- Grammar of Graphics (gg)
    - data
    - aesthetics
    - geom
- Plotly - interactive plots
    - we are using it to easily make ggplot objects interactive
- Anything to review here?


## Objectives
- Basic: produce a simple dashboard
- Intermediate: basic + create more complicated layouts
    - add pages
    - tabsets
    - dropdown menus
- Advanced - interactive dashboards + your own data
- Questions before we start??


## RMarkdown Basics {.smaller}
Begin an Rmarkdown file (File -> New -> R Markdown)
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_labels.png" width="95%" />


## RMarkdown Basics: the YAML and the layout 
- YAML = Yet Another Markdown Language
- RStudio creates this automatically
- Can be tweaked to provide a lot of control over the output (not covered)
- RStudio has a standard layout that can be modified 


## RMarkdown Basics: columns and headers
- Can organize layout by rows (not covered)
- Columns are created with "Column" and "---------"
- Swiggly brackets {} can be used to control the output
    - e.g. can specify column width with {data = width = 650}
- Headers are specified with "###" and a "title"


## RMarkdown Basics {.smaller}
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_labels.png" width="95%" />


## RMarkdown basics: the "chunk"
- The "r chunk"
    - Start a r chunk: type ```{r}
    - Type some R code
    - End a r chunk: type ```
- For dashboards, 
    - the "text chunk" is optional
    - text chunk goes in between the header and r chunks


## RMarkdown Basics: the "r chunk with code"
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_chunks.png" width="95%" />

## Rmarkdown basics: the setup chunk
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard.png" width="95%" />


## Rmarkdown basics: the setup chunk
- A chunk that doesn't produce any output but useful for:
    - loading packages (e.g. library (ggplot2))
    - reading/manipulating data 
- Note: Lots of options are available to control output within the {}
    - E.g., the "{r setup}" - you can name your chunks but this is optional
    - E.g.,  "include = FALSE" means output will not be displayed


## Rmarkdown basics: the Knit button
- click on "Knit" button to run code and specify output


## Basic Exercise I
- Open RStudio
- begin an R markdown file (File -> New -> R Markdown)
- Choose "From template", make sure "Flexdashboard" is selected, hit OK
- File -> Save As -> name the file
- "knit" the file -> choose "Knit to html"

- Now, add some cars plots and "knit" again

## Basic Exercise II
- Now it's your turn (hint: recycle your code!!!!)
- Create a new dashboard file and modify the setup chunk
    - load the packages readr, ggplot2, plotly, and knitr
    - read in the abiotic data file
- Copy the code for three plots (ggplotly or cars) into the r chunks
- "knit" the file -> choose "Knit to html"
- Open in browser
- Check to see the figures appear where you want them to and are interactive


## Intermediate RMarkdown 
- Step 1
    - add pages
    - change the layout (columns to rows)
- Step 2
    - add tabsets
    - dropdown menus


## RMarkdown Intermediate: pages
- In a markdown document, hashtags create headers (more hashtags = smaller header)
- In a dashboard, hashtags create:
    - pages (#)
    - headers on the page (###)
- Columns 
    - add or delete columns
    - nest figures within columns
    - hint 2-3 columns and 2-3 rows are about max.
- See https://pkgs.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/articles/layouts.html


## RMarkdown Intermediate: layout, tabset, drop downs
- Tabset 
    - Column {.tabset}
    - Delete "extra" columns
- Dropdown menu
    - Column {data-navmenu="The Page"}


## Intermediate Exercises I
- Copy the first exercise to a new file (save it) and modify it as follows
- We want 4 cars figures for this exercise
- Add a page and add the fourth graph (2 figures per page)
- Knit this to make sure it works

## Intermediate Exercises II
- Using the previous Int Exercise:
- On one page, tabset the figures
- On the other page, create a dropdown menu (needs two pages)
- Knit the file
- Hint: do this in steps (tabset first, dropdown second)

## Advanced exercises
Repeat intermediate exercises but with your data - we're here to help


## Thoughts on workflow
- make sure the file is read the way it should be (data types)
- make the static graph
- make the interactive graph
- put it in dashboard
- as dashboards get bigger, it may be helpful to try the interactive plots in a "test" dashboard first as it will compile faster
