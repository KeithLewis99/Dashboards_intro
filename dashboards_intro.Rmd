## Before we get started
- Have you installed packages knitr, rmarkdown, flexdashboard, and all previous ones?
- Could you click on File -> New -> R Markdown -> from template?
    - Did you see an option for "Flex dashboard"
- Did you create a new RStudio project and associated folder?
- Do you have the abiotic data set in this folder (or data sub-folder)?
- Anything we need to review (R, RStudio, readr)???

## What this workshop is about
- Making interactive dashboards, i.e. putting your ggplotly objects into a dashboard, i.e. a single file interactive html file

- This workshop is not about:
    - dynamic documents
    - reproducible research
    - a markdown tutorial
- A workshop on making Rmarkdown documents is available if interested


## Review markdown
- Markdown is a light weight, text-to-html language (not R)
- R Markdown enables R code to be embedded in the markdown language
- knitr and rmarkdown packages: “knits” R code with text; converts the R Markdown files into various formats (html, Word, pdf, PowerPoint)
- Using this approach you can:
    - make documents, presentations, or dashboards (posters)
    - output as html, pdf, Word/PowerPoint, etc

## Review ggplot2 and plotly
- grammar of graphics
    - data
    - aesthetics
    - geom
- plotly - interactive plots
    - we are using it to easily make ggplot objects interactive

## Objectives
- Basic: produce a simple dashboard with interactive graphs
- Intermediate: basic + create more complicated layouts
    - add pages
    - tabsets
- Advanced: ??????


- Questions before we start??

## RMarkdown Basics {.smaller}
Begin an R markdown file (File -> New -> R Markdown)
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_labels.png" width="95%" />


## RMarkdown Basics: the YAML and the layout 
- YAML = Yet Another Markdown Language
- RStudio creates this automatically
- Can be tweaked to provide a lot of control over the output (not covered)
- RStudio has a standard layout that can be modified 


## RMarkdown Basics: columns and headers
- Can organize layout by rows (not covered)
- Columns are created with "Column" and "---------"
- Can specify column width {data = width = 650}
- Headers are specified with "###" and a "title"


## RMarkdown Basics {.smaller}
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_labels.png" width="95%" />


## RMarkdown basics: the "chunk"
- The "r chunk"
    - Start a r chunk: type ```{r}
    - Type some R code
    - End a r chunk: type ```
- For dashboards, 
    - the "text chunk" is optional
    - text chunk goes in between the header and r chunks


## RMarkdown Basics: the "r chunk with code"
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard_chunks.png" width="95%" />


## Rmarkdown basics: the setup chunk
- A chunk that doesn't produce any output but useful for:
    - loading packages (e.g. library (ggplot2))
    - reading/manipulating data 
- Note: the "{r setup}" - you can name your chunks but this is optional
- Note: "include = FALSE" means output will not be displayed


## Rmarkdown basics: the setup chunk
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard.png" width="95%" />

## Rmarkdown basics: the Knit button
- click on "Knit" button to run code and specify output

## Basic Exercise I
- begin an R markdown file (File -> New -> R Markdown)
- Choose "From template", make sure "Flexdashboard" is selected, hit OK
- File -> Save As -> name the file
- "knit" the file -> choose "Knit to html"

## Basic Exercise II
- Now it's your turn (hint: recycle your code!!!!)
- Setup chunk
    - load the packages readr, knitr, and rmarkdown
    - read in the abiotic data file
- copy the code for three ggplotly objects into the r chunks
- "knit" the file -> choose "Knit to html"
- open in browser
- check to see the figures appear where you want them to and are interactive

## Intermediate RMarkdown 
- Add pages
- more complicated layouts

## RMarkdown Intermediate: pages
- In a markdown document, hashtags create headers (more hashtags = smaller header)
- In a dashboard, hashtags create:
    - pages (#)
    - headers on the page (###)
- See
https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/layouts.html


## RMarkdown intermediate: The dashboard layout
Hashtags - they're not just for Twitter
<style> 
  #slideID > p { 
    margin-top: -100px; 
  } 
</style>
<img src="figures/6_Rstudio_Dashboard.png" width="95%" />


## RMarkdown Intermediate: tabsets
SHOW TABSETS

## RMarkdown intermediate exercises
DO ALL THE ABOVE
Page
Tabset
Change layout

Copy the first exercise to a new file (save it) and produce the following document

## Advanced RMarkdown
Drop downs????

## Advanced exercises
- Copy the second exercise to a new file (save it) and produce the following document
- Hint: the summary is the mean and SD of depth by NAFO division - use the tidyverse


- .....then update it  to 2010 :)
  
## Next steps in RMarkdown {.smaller}
 - YAML headers
 - hooks
 - inserting graphics
 - Presentations (ioslides and RPres)
 - Adding bibliographies
 - templates
 - insert equations
 - Notebooks
 - packrat (so package updates don't mess things up)
 - Plotly
 - Ctrl-Shift-k
 - package editR
